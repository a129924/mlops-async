# mlops-async

Async Python library scaffold for SAS Viya REST API operations.

## Status

This repository is currently a **project scaffold**. The package layout, tooling,
quality gates, and agent-governance files are in place; the public client API is
not implemented yet.

## Goals

- Use `httpx.AsyncClient` for all HTTP operations
- Validate API payloads with Pydantic v2
- Keep strict typing with Pyright
- Separate unit tests from integration tests
- Provide a reusable library for downstream projects

## API porting workflow

This project uses a contract-first workflow for translating `sasctl` and legacy
SDK behavior into async client code. Future API porting work must first extract
source request contracts, write request-contract tests, define response/error
boundaries, and update `docs/porting-ledger.md` before claiming compatibility.

## Requirements

- Python `3.10`
- `uv`

## Install

```bash
uv sync
```

## Development quick start

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run pyright
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```
