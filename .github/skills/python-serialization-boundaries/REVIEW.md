## Checklist Results

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Required Core** | ✅ PASS | SKILL.md, reference.md, and examples.md all present |
| **SKILL.md frontmatter** | ✅ PASS | name and description fields present |
| **Purpose section** | ✅ PASS | Clear semantic translation mandate |
| **Trigger / When to use** | ✅ PASS | Explicit positive triggers and clear negative boundaries |
| **Inputs section** | ✅ PASS | Lists all relevant input categories |
| **Process section** | ✅ PASS | 8-step procedure with clear stopping points |
| **Examples section** | ✅ PASS | 8 lines; concise positive and negative examples |
| **Outputs section** | ✅ PASS | Clear deliverables listed |
| **Boundaries section** | ✅ PASS | 5 handoff rules; adjacent skills named |
| **Local references** | ✅ PASS | Both reference.md and examples.md roles declared |
| **Concise positive example** | ✅ PASS | PATCH payload parsing with type normalization |
| **Concise negative example** | ✅ PASS | Raw dict passthrough, collapsed None semantics |
| **Example size fit** | ✅ PASS | 8 lines / 142 lines = 5.6% of SKILL.md |
| **Single responsibility** | ✅ PASS | Semantic translation boundaries only; adjacent skills own type hints, models, exceptions, modules, architecture |
| **Portability** | ✅ PASS | Framework-neutral rules with optional framework notes; self-contained |
| **Independence** | ✅ PASS | Depends only on adjacent skills (python-model-selection, python-error-handling, python-module-boundaries, python-type-hints-strict) |
| **Trigger clarity** | ✅ PASS | Narrow, actionable; negative triggers prevent scope creep |
| **Verification section** | ✅ PASS | 5 concrete checks for boundary design |
| **Red Flags section** | ✅ PASS | 5 anti-patterns that signal incomplete translation |
| **Common Rationalizations** | ✅ PASS | 5 faulty arguments addressed |
| **Reference depth** | ✅ PASS | 93 lines; focused on semantic gatekeeper framing, hard rules, and handoff |
| **Examples.md depth** | ✅ PASS | 212 lines; covers PATCH semantics, asymmetric DTOs, normalization, deep conversion, lossy output, local-vs-shared schemas |
| **Risk-based validation fit** | ✅ PASS | Lightweight skill (no gatekeeper responsibility) appropriately supported by reference + examples without heavyweight checklist |
| **Boundaries precision** | ✅ PASS | Handoff table lists 7 adjacent concerns and target skills explicitly |

## Strengths

1. **Clear semantic framing**: The skill centers on "raw transport shapes stop at the boundary" — a portable, framework-neutral rule with immediate practical value.

2. **Well-calibrated scope**: Positive triggers (API payloads, database rows, PATCH semantics, DTO separation) and negative triggers (type hints, model construct choice, exceptions, module policy) prevent scope creep into adjacent skills.

3. **Exemplary structure**:
   - `SKILL.md` is concise (142 lines) with 5.6% dedicated to examples — proportional and focused
   - Positive example: PATCH parsing with omission vs explicit `null` vs unchanged
   - Negative example: raw dict passthrough, collapsed semantics
   - Both are concise and action-oriented

4. **Rich supporting material**:
   - `reference.md` (93 lines): 6 hard rules + adjacent-skill handoff map + framework notes supplement
   - `examples.md` (212 lines): 8 branching example pairs covering all major decision points
   - No reference file exceeds 1,000 tokens or mixes more than 3 unrelated topics

5. **Verification + Red Flags sections**: Move beyond process into observable signals that code reviewers can check without deep knowledge of the skill.

6. **Effective handoff map**: Clearly names 7 adjacent concerns and their target skills, making it easy to route ambiguous questions.

7. **Framework-neutral defaults**: Core rules stay framework-agnostic; examples briefly mention Pydantic unset tracking as a helper, not a requirement.
