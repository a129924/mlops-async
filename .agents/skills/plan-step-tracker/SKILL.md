name: plan-step-tracker
description: Query step status (pending/done) in plan/<topic>/<topic>.step.md with minimal token cost and explicit blocking when incomplete.
complexity: medium
risk_profile:
  - external_tooling
inputs:
  - topic name that maps to plan/<topic>/<topic>.step.md
  - "operation: read_all, read_not_run, read_success, check_all_succeeded, or check_impl_steps_succeeded"
outputs:
  - Python CLI stdout with matching step lines or success/blocked summary
  - exit code 0 or 1 that the caller can use as a workflow gate
  - stderr warning/error text for lowercase [x] or missing files
use_when:
  - you need a read-only status query for one topic's .step.md file
  - you need exit-code blocking before continuing a workflow or review step
  - you need fallback grep guidance when the Python CLI cannot run
do_not_use_when:
  - you need to modify step files or mark steps complete
  - you need to aggregate multiple topics or verify evidence outside the checkbox file
  - you need live monitoring or richer states than done versus pending
---

# Purpose

Provide a low-token, read-only way to query `plan/<topic>/<topic>.step.md` and enforce blocking when incomplete work remains.

# Trigger / When to use

Use this skill when:
- you need the status of one topic's `.step.md` file without reading the whole file
- you need a blocking gate that stops follow-on work when any step is still pending
- you need the canonical Python CLI contract for step queries
- you need grep fallback guidance because the Python CLI cannot run

Do not use this skill when:
- you need to edit `.step.md` files or change checkbox markers
- you need to query more than one topic in one pass
- you need to prove that external artifacts exist beyond what the checkbox file declares
- you need a watcher, daemon, or real-time progress monitor

# Inputs

- `<topic>`: required topic name; resolves to `plan/<topic>/<topic>.step.md`
- `<operation>`: one of `read_all`, `read_not_run`, `read_success`, `check_all_succeeded`, or `check_impl_steps_succeeded`
- current working directory at repository root so the Python CLI and fallback paths resolve correctly

# Process

1. Resolve `plan/<topic>/<topic>.step.md` and keep the interaction read-only.
2. Prefer the Python CLI:
   ```bash
   python .agents/skills/plan-step-tracker/scripts/step_tracker.py <operation> <topic>
   ```
3. Interpret checkbox markers exactly as the CLI does:
   - `[X]` = done
   - `[ ]` = pending
   - `[x]` = pending, with a warning on stderr
4. Preserve the command contract by honoring exit codes:
   - `read_all`, `read_not_run`, `read_success` return exit code `0` on successful reads
   - `check_all_succeeded` returns exit code `0` only when nothing is pending
   - `check_impl_steps_succeeded` returns exit code `0` only when `## Implementation Steps` contains no pending items
   - missing `.step.md` returns exit code `1` and is blocking
5. If Python CLI execution is unavailable, use the grep fallback from `reference.md`, and explicitly note that grep cannot reproduce the lowercase `[x]` warning by itself.
6. Never modify `.step.md`, normalize checkbox casing, or continue past a blocking `check_all_succeeded` result.

# Examples

**Positive: Use the blocking command before a gated handoff**
```bash
$ python .agents/skills/plan-step-tracker/scripts/step_tracker.py check_all_succeeded my-feature
❌ BLOCKED: 2 steps pending (exit code 1)
[ ] implementation-review
[x] code-review
```
The caller stops and reports the pending steps.

**Negative: Treat lowercase `[x]` as complete or ignore exit code 1**
```bash
$ python .agents/skills/plan-step-tracker/scripts/step_tracker.py check_all_succeeded my-feature
Warning: Found lowercase [x] at line 18; treating as pending
❌ BLOCKED: 1 steps pending (exit code 1)
[x] code-review
```
Wrong follow-up: continuing anyway or rewriting the file inside this skill.

# Outputs

- `read_all`: all parsed checkbox lines on stdout; exit code `0`
- `read_not_run`: pending lines on stdout, including lowercase `[x]`; exit code `0`
- `read_success`: completed `[X]` lines on stdout; exit code `0`
- `check_all_succeeded`: success summary with exit code `0`, or blocked summary plus pending lines with exit code `1`
- `check_impl_steps_succeeded`: implementation-only success summary with exit code `0`, or blocked summary plus pending implementation lines with exit code `1`
- errors: `Error: File not found: plan/<topic>/<topic>.step.md` on stderr with exit code `1`

# Validation

## Required Checks
 - run only one of the five supported operations
- keep the command path as `python .agents/skills/plan-step-tracker/scripts/step_tracker.py <operation> <topic>`
- treat exit code `1` from `check_all_succeeded` or missing files as blocking
- treat exit code `1` from `check_impl_steps_succeeded` as an implementation-only blocking signal
- treat lowercase `[x]` as pending, not done
- keep the workflow read-only

## Quality Checks (best effort)
- prefer the Python CLI over grep so warning and exit-code semantics stay exact
- if fallback grep is used, disclose the lowercase `[x]` limitation explicitly
- keep output concise by returning only the requested subset of steps

## On Soft Fail
- mark the result `INCOMPLETE` when the caller's desired operation is unclear
- state any fallback limitations explicitly
- do not fabricate completion state beyond the file contents

# Failure Handling

## Missing Context
- if `<topic>` is missing or does not resolve to a single expected path, mark the result `BLOCKED` and request the exact topic name
- if the caller does not specify an operation and intent does not clearly imply one, mark the result `INCOMPLETE`

## Ambiguous Requirement
- if the caller asks a broad question like "check the plan" without saying whether they need pending steps, completed steps, all steps, or a blocking gate, do not guess when that choice could change downstream behavior
- if a fallback command is used, say that warning behavior for lowercase `[x]` must be checked manually

## Execution Limitation
- if Python CLI execution is unavailable, fall back to grep guidance from `reference.md`
- if neither Python nor grep can be run safely, stop at `BLOCKED` rather than inferring status from memory

# Verification

- verify exit code `0` from `check_all_succeeded` before continuing a gated workflow
- verify exit code `1` blocks continuation when any pending step or missing file is reported
- verify `check_impl_steps_succeeded` inspects only `## Implementation Steps` and ignores pending items outside that section
- verify lowercase `[x]` remains pending and produces a warning when the Python CLI is used
- verify fallback grep guidance is presented as an approximation, not as a replacement for the CLI warning behavior

# Boundaries

- read-only only; this skill does not update step files
- single-topic only; no aggregation across multiple plan folders
- checkbox-state only; no evidence validation for artifacts outside the `.step.md` file
- no extra status model beyond done versus pending
- no behavior changes to the local Python CLI contract
